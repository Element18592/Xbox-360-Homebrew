XDash is a very simple, user friendly, text based tool to manipulate the Xbox 360.

XDash is in a very early stage, but so far can do the following:

Handle user input from the 360 controller
Display the system hardware temperatures in real time.
Shut down the console
Automatically regulate the console fan speed based on component temperatures.

It isn't much, but it's progress. Eventually, XDash will be abel to:

Soft reboot the console
Provide (T/)FTP access
NAND reading/writing tools
Fan speed controller
etc

XDash is still in a very early state, but I plan to rapidly develop it in the next few weeks.

Enjoy!
