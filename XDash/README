I have backed up the old XDash source code into the OLD directory. The original source code for XDash when it was first created can be found there. 

I am currently working on re-designing XDash, so much so that I have moved it to it's own repository since it is growing much larger.

New developments can be found at https://github.com/IUNIXI/XDash
