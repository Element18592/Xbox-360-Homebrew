Welcome to my personal Xbox 360 homebrew git repository!

Here you will find various projects, all of which incorporate LibXenon, the free and open source library for the Xbox 360. I've set up this repository specifically for LibXenon.org and it's members, so that there can be a public resource for the community to learn from. I have many projects using LibXenon, and most of them will be posted here for public modification, usage, and research.

Please feel free to grab anything you want from this repository. I will do my best to provide good documentation with every project within the code so that it is easy to read and understand.

Thanks, and enjoy!
